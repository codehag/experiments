Thank you for participating in this experiment. It will help us evaluate <Lanugage Feature>
for inclusion in the ECMAScript standard. You may one day see this in the language, or you
might not. But firstly:

**The questions here are not intended to test you as a programmer.**

We are testing how the language performs for developers, and what kind of issues can come up for a developer with a new piece of syntax. If you find yourself unsure, or afraid you are making a mistake, please feel confident that if you _are_ making a mistake, then it will help us change the language so that it is better.

We are working on determining how to identify good syntactic changes to the JavaScript language. In order to do this, we need everyoneâ€™s help, since everyone has a different approach to the language. The experiment that you are participating in now is to help us evaluate how a new language feature might or might not work. This way we can identify issues like readability, cognative load, and learning curve early on.
